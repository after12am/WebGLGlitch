WebGL Glitch
============

This is a web application to [glitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch) your image or movie in realtime in your blowser easily and is a simplified version of [ofxTLGlitch](https://github.com/after12am/ofxTLGlitch) that runs on [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) as addon. This application is on basis of [glfx.js](http://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/) that is a sophisticated image effect library created by [evanw](https://github.com/evanw). I developed glitch effect for this library in my fork. But glitch effect have not been incorporated to original glfx.js. So if you like it, use [this](http://after12am.github.io/glfx.js/glfx.js).
