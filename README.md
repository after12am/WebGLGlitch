WebGL Glitch
============

This is a web application to [glitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch) your image or movie 
in realtime in your blowser easily and is a simplified version of [ofxTLGlitch](https://github.com/after12am/ofxTLGlitch) 
that runs on [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) as addon. This application 
is on basis of [glfx.js](http://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/) that is a sophisticated image effect library 
created by [evanw](https://github.com/evanw). I developed glitch effect for this library 
in my fork. But this effect does not be incorporated to original 
for different design concept. So if you like this effect, use [this](http://after12am.github.io/glfx.js/glfx.js).
