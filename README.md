WebGL Glitch
============

This is a web application using WebGL. This allows you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch">glitch</a> your image or video 
in real time in your browser. I prepares glitch controller. So you can do little animation. 
When you are interested in this, please try <a href="https://github.com/after12am/ofxTLGlitch">ofxTLGlitch</a> which runs with openframeworks as addon. 
This addon allows you to do more flexible glitch animation.

This application uses improved image effect library which is originally created by <a href="https://github.com/evanw">evanw</a>. 
As the library don't provides glitch effect, I incorporated the glitch effect into that. 
If you want to know more infomation about the library called by glfx.js, visit <a href="https://github.com/evanw/glfx.js">glfx.js</a>.
