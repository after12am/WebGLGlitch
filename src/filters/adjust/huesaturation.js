/**
 * @filter           Hue / Saturation
 * @description      Provides rotational hue and multiplicative saturation control. RGB color space
 *                   can be imagined as a cube where the axes are the red, green, and blue color
 *                   values. Hue changing works by rotating the color vector around the grayscale
 *                   line, which is the straight line from black (0, 0, 0) to white (1, 1, 1).
 *                   Saturation is implemented by scaling all color channel values either toward
 *                   or away from the average color channel value.
 * @param hue        -1 to 1 (-1 is 180 degree rotation in the negative direction, 0 is no change,
 *                   and 1 is 180 degree rotation in the positive direction)
 * @param saturation -1 to 1 (-1 is solid gray, 0 is no change, and 1 is maximum contrast)
